# Restricted-Rock-Paper-Scissors
My very first personal python project that is based on the anime, Kaiji. I used a little artistic freedom in putting in Akagi, from another anime, as Kaiji's adversary.

You can play against the computer, which just chooses different hands randomly, or against another human player locally on the same screen.

With regard to the point system:
I used to have it work so that it took away and gave a point respectively to the loser and winner of a round, 
and being able to win only by reaching a certain amount of points, else both players suffer defeat (no ties, just losers. lol),
which would have been more faithful to the anime.
I found just playing until you reach a certain amount of points, without subtracting them, to be the funnest though; so, that's the final product.
The only way to both lose is if both players end up with the same points.


I hope you enjoy it!

I do not claim to own any images or audio in the entirety of this project.
